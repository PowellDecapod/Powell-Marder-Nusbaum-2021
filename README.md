Scripts and metadata used for the CabPK Manuscript.

CabPK_new contains RTXI scripts used for IMI-CCAP experiments; CabPK_new.cpp contains the actual code used, other file either allow you to declare variables (.H file) or are necessary for RTXI to run the script

Spike2 scripts contain analysis code for analyzing raw data in Spike2. Scripts were written by members of Marder Lab past and present, as well as others (i.e. Dirk Bucher).

Excel file contains metadata for all experiments and contains files numbers for raw data files that were analyzed. Also contains metadata for statistical analysis. Tabs are either labeled by experiment (Notebook# _ Page#; i.e. 941_045 is from notebook# 941, page 45) or by data comparisons (i.e. CabPKvsCabPK+CCAP). Within an experiment tab, metadata will be labeled by Notebook#, page#, and raw data file. Raw data files can be obtained by emailing me (danielpowell212@gmail.com) or contacting the Marder Lab. Raw data is either in the form of ABF or Spike2 files. ABFLoad script will load ABF files into MATLAB.
